Most important to me: 

* receive instructions via email

* reads any paragraph (including subject line) starting with "remember" or
* "remind me [to]" 

* understands a variety of date/time formats ("tuesday", "12/23",
* "tomorrow")

* emails each reminder at the appropriate time (or at the beginning of the
* day if no time is specified)

Even if the new Sandy had ONLY the above features, that would be sufficient
for me personally. Other nice things, in order of personal preference:

* web interface to quickly edit tasks without back-and-forth querying

* daily digest

* twitter interface

* repeatable reminders 

* (new feature) configurability for how far in advance to remind you of
* something

* (new feature) IM interface

* address book
